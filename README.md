# Lieconv-Tg
This is the code repo for the paper .We collected most of the homopolymer data from Polyinfo and further processed it to obtain a larger dataset.We used this dataset to build a neural network based on lieconv to predict the glass transition temperature of the polymer. We used this dataset to build a neural network based on lieconv to predict the glass transition temperature of the polymer. We collected most of the homopolymer data from Polyinfo and further processed it to obtain a larger dataset.We used this dataset to build a neural network based on lieconv to predict the glass transition temperature of the polymer.For each molecule, there are "Pubchem ID", "SMILES", "InChi", "Inchikey", "Molecular Weight", "Exact Mass", "Formula" and predicted CCS values of three adduct ion types.
