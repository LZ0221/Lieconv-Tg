# Lieconv-Tg
This is the code repo for the paper Large-scale Glass Transition Temperature Prediction with Equivariant Graph Neural Network for Screening Polymers .We collected most of the homopolymer data from Polyinfo and further processed it to obtain a larger dataset containing 7246 homopolymer data.We used this dataset to build a neural network based on Lieconv to predict the glass transition temperature of the polymer.Using the same dataset, we also constructed an Image-CNN model and an Eccconv-based model. In contrast, the Lieconv-based model has better predictive and derivative power and is also used for subsequent screening of promising candidates from a benchmark database, named PI1M.

Package required:
